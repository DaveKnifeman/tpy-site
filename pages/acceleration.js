            "As the Formula Student Team Delft we have built our carbon fibre monocoque in the Scale Up & Innovation Center. It was great to be surrounded by other teams and companies doing similar production, so we could exchange knowledge and help each other. After our monocoque was finished we assembled our electric racecar, in order to participate in the international Formula Student competitions in the summer of 2021. We have so far won the Engineering Design and Cost & Manufacturing event at Formula Student Netherlands, and are ready to race for more prizes at the Red Bull Ring and the Hockenheimring!
          </p>
          <p>
            We are looking forward to build our next autonomous racecar at the facilities that TPY has to offer."
