        Why a code of conduct?
      </Title>

      <p>
        At The Hague Tech we aim to have a safe and inclusive community. Our code of conduct allows us to achieve this together. It sets forth how we interact positively with each other, how we make use of our facilities, and how we foster a positive community. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Our code of conduct helps us achieve this. It outlines how we interact with each other, how we make use of the facilities, and what you can do to have a positive influence on the community.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Hague Tech is committed to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religious affiliation. We do not tolerate harassment in any form. Event participants violating these rules may face consequences including, but not limited to, expulsion from the facilities without a refund. By joining our community or attending an event, you are agreeing to abide by these guidelines. We expect our community to help us realize a safe and positive experience for everyone.

        Live like at home, not a hotel
      </Title>

      <p>
        Our office is a shared space where we all want to feel at home and welcome. This requires us to take particular care of the cleanliness and organization of the space. If you decide to pick up, use, or modify anything within the space please leave it as you found it or in better shape. Treat our shared space with care. And for individuals with enclosed space, treat your space with care as to keep a warm and welcoming environment for all. 
      </p>

      <p>
        It is everyone’s responsibility to clean their own dishes, refill the coffee machine and keep it clean, tidy their areas and provide and clean working environment for everyone. 
      </p>

      <br /><br />

      <Title size="small">
        No Poaching
      </Title>

      <p>
        Great talent is all around us and is what makes our community what it is. Therefore, we must take measures to protect the companies and individuals within our space. Poaching - approaching team members from other The Hague Tech resident or member companies with job offers with an intent to recruit - is not permitted. If team members approach your company with an application, treat it as you would any other, with respect and confidentiality. Poaching is seperate from collaboration, as we encourage synergy building and collaboration efforts between companies and individuals. This should always be done with the intent to grow both parties rather than taking advantage of one another. 
      </p>

      <Title size="small">
