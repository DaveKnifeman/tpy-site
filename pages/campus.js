      <p>
        The goal of our TPY Campus is to offer facilities and events to support all your needs with easy access and close to Den Haag. Whether youâ€™re a start up, scale up, a mature business or an international company. Come visit our vibrant campus and see it for yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        TPY is conveniently located between The Hague and Delft, right next to the A4 and close to the Laan van Ypenburg tram- and bus stop. We also have plenty of parking facilities at our park!
      </p>
      <p>
        TPY is located near educational institutions such as TU Delft, InHolland, and The Hague University of Applied Sciences. At TPY, students have the ability to cooperate and co-create with fellow students from different schools, whilst networking with  companies at our Production Center. This way, TPY offers a unique experience for students!
      </p>
      <p>
        Students have worked on various projects in the past at the TPY Scale-up & Innovation Center. We have welcomed teams such as the DragonFly Team by InHolland Delft, and the Formula- and EcoRunner Team by TU Delft. Our Production Center offers plenty of space and all the tools needed to help students achieve their best and most innovative projects possible.
