      text="<p>
        The Hague Tech is home to diverse and engaging labs created by our members and facilitated by THT. Our labs are physical spaces with weekly or monthly Meetups, bringing entrepreneurs and innovators together to stimulate co-working, knowledge exchange, and new projects. The Hague Tech currently houses a blockchain lab (<a href='https://blockbar.nl' target='_blank'>Blockbar</a>), an artificial intelligence lab (<a href='https://ailab.one/' target='_blank'>AI Lab</a>), and the Smart Building Techlab. Additional labs are currently in development, including a government lab and a pension lab. AI Lab was the <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hague-europes-4th-fastest-growing-tech-hub-look-charles-weiler-ulin/' target='_blank'>#1 Meetup in The Hague</a> while Blockbar was #3. Our labs helped propel the Hague to the 4th fastest growing tech hub in Europe.
